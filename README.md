# Intervention-Base64Image

Use: 
Handle base64 encoded images send to server

Use case:
On implementing APIs that accept images in base64encoded format, we have to write the image to filesystem to validate the image (mime type and) and more.
THis library provides an easy method of doing this by extending Intervention\Imag library
